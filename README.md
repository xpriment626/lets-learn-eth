## FREE ETHEREUM AND SOLIDITY LEARNING RESOURCE

My content is structured in a way that encourages self-study and hands-on experimentation rather than fully structured course-like material. I go over smart contract basics with the assumption that readers have existing knowledge of at least the very basics of programming.

The industry generally frowns upon taking Solidity as a first language, as the EVM-centric nature of it leaves considerable knowledge gaps in areas such as string manipulation and basic web technologies.

This repo and the attached Notion Reading List are meant to go hand in hand, with readers able to easily access the lesser talked about topics such as Ethereum denominations, hashing, and unit conversions. The eading list resources come in various mediums including videos, articles, and podcasts. It's intended to be a one-stop spot to excercise Ethereum muscle memory and gain familiarity in more advanced topics not typically covered by blockchain development courses.

### Donations/Support

My goal isn't to turn a profit with this, especially as I'm rather new to the space myself. But I would appreciate any amount of support as it would give me leeway to focus more on polishing, updating, and adding content.
